# 🧭 Yaw Direction Fix - NED Convention Alignment

## 🔍 **Issue Discovered**

During testing, you observed a **sign inconsistency** between magnetometer and gyroscope yaw calculations:

- **Gyroscope**: Yaw increases **clockwise (CW)** ✅ (correct for NED)
- **Magnetometer**: Yaw increases **counter-clockwise (CCW)** ❌ (wrong for NED)

## 📐 **NED Convention for Yaw**

In **NED (North-East-Down)** coordinates:
- **X-axis**: North
- **Y-axis**: East  
- **Z-axis**: Down
- **Positive Yaw**: **Clockwise rotation** around Z-axis when viewed from above

### **Yaw Angle Reference:**
- **0°**: North
- **90°**: East
- **180°**: South
- **270°**: West

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```python
yaw_rad = math.atan2(-mag_y_comp, mag_x_comp)  # CCW positive
```

### **After (Correct):**
```python
yaw_rad = math.atan2(mag_y_comp, mag_x_comp)   # CW positive
```

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**

### **For Sensor Fusion (EKF):**
- **Gyroscope** and **magnetometer** must use the **same sign convention**
- **Inconsistent signs** would cause EKF to fight between sensor inputs
- **Consistent CW positive** aligns with NED standard and aviation conventions

### **For Navigation:**
- **Aviation standard**: Heading increases clockwise (0° = North, 90° = East)
- **Marine standard**: Same convention
- **Robotics**: Typically follows NED for outdoor applications

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

Both magnetometer and gyroscope should now show:
- **Turning right** (clockwise): Yaw increases
- **Turning left** (counter-clockwise): Yaw decreases
- **Pointing North**: Yaw ≈ 0° (or 360°)
- **Pointing East**: Yaw ≈ 90°

## 🧪 **Test Verification**

### **Quick Test:**
1. **Point sensor North** → Both mag and gyro yaw should read ≈ 0°
2. **Rotate clockwise** → Both should increase together
3. **Rotate counter-clockwise** → Both should decrease together

### **Detailed Test:**
1. Start pointing North (0°)
2. Rotate 90° clockwise → Should read ≈ 90° (East)
3. Continue to 180° → Should read ≈ 180° (South)  
4. Continue to 270° → Should read ≈ 270° (West)
5. Return to 360°/0° → Should read ≈ 0° (North)

## 💡 **Key Insight**

This fix demonstrates the importance of **coordinate system consistency**:

1. **Raw sensor calibration** must be in sensor's native coordinates
2. **NED transformation** must preserve proper sign conventions
3. **All calculations** must follow the same angular reference frame

## 🚀 **Impact on EKF Implementation**

With this fix, your EKF will now have:
- **Consistent yaw measurements** from all sensors
- **Proper sensor fusion** without sign conflicts
- **Correct heading estimation** following aviation standards
